A Collaborate project by Matt Clancy and Seth Spring. 
Faux Fugitives uses the FBI API to pull a list of most wanted & missing persons.
From that list you can find information on the crime commited and a reward, if applicable. 
Missing persons will show last known location with an image and inforamtion. 
You can also sumbit a new 'fugitive' (we will use this term lightly) to report inconvenicne crimes. i.e. someone who used the last of the paper towels and didn't restock, or a fugitive who owes you a drink for a lost bet. 
We will have 3 listeners, one being a submit button, another being mouseover, and we will have an alert with the submit button.
